# Weekly Planner App

## Description

Note - I worked on setting the colours of past/present/future classes for hours & a TA helped a huge amount but we both couldn't work out the bug together. If you can provide the solution it would be great to help my learning?

The weekly planner app has been built so I can better plan my days at work & can schedule things in by the hour, due to me being slightly unorganised at work.

It has allowed me to get back on top of my work & I have learned a huge amount in the build of this, including JQuery & improving my knowledge on local storage.

## Usage

To access the weekly planner app, you can find links to the code and a working version online below

When using yourself, simply type your activity in the text area for the hour you would like & click save it will store there. A screenshot of it in use is below
